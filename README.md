# 📘 Chapter 7: Structured Exception Handling - *CSharpPro*

Chapter 7 of *CSharpPro* focuses on **Structured Exception Handling** in C#. It provides essential concepts and techniques to manage runtime errors, ensuring code is robust, clean, and easy to debug.

## 🔍 Understanding Exception Types
- **`SystemException`** ⚙️ - Represents system-level errors (e.g., `NullReferenceException`, `IndexOutOfRangeException`) often arising from runtime issues.
- **`ApplicationException`** 🧩 - Intended for application-specific errors, helpful for adding meaningful custom exceptions related to business logic.

## 🛠 Exception Handling Basics
- **`try-catch`** 🎯 - Wrap risky code in a `try` block and catch specific exceptions in `catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully.
- **`finally`** 🔒 - Ensures cleanup actions are taken, like closing resources, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.
- **`throw`** 🚀 - Re-throws an exception to higher-level code for handling, preserving the original stack trace for debugging.

## 📝 Practical Tips
- **Catch Specific Exceptions** ✔️ - Avoid catch-all blocks; handle only specific exceptions to keep debugging straightforward and improve efficiency.
- **Use Custom Exceptions Thoughtfully** 📐 - Only add custom exceptions when it provides clear, meaningful error contexts for the application.
- **Resource Management with `finally`** 💾 - Always release resources, like database connections, in `finally` blocks to prevent memory leaks.
